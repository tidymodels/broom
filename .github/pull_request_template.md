Thanks for making a pull request to broom! A few things to keep in mind that will probably help this PR be merged more quickly:  

* Have you documented the change in `NEWS.md`?  
* If this is your first time PRing to broom, have you added yourself as a contributor in the `DESCRIPTION`?
* Have you added any new vocabulary to `inst/WORDLIST`? (New vocabulary will be noted in the R-CMD-check from GitHub Actions.)
* Does R-CMD-check pass on GitHub Actions? (Sometimes, checks may not be passing on the main branch alreadyâ€”if that's the case, just try to make sure your changes don't add any additional errors/warnings.) 
* Have you updated `DESCRIPTION` if your feature/bug fix requires a specific version of a package?
* Have you added unit tests for any new functionality?

Feel free to convert these questions to a checklist by switching out `*` with `* [ ]` if it's helpful for you. :-)

If your PR fixes a bug, a [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) of the bug would be much appreciated!

If your PR adds new tidiers for external model objects, please link to prior attempts to add these tidiers to the model-exporting package, and include a reprex of the new tidiers' functionality! You can learn more about writing tidiers for model-exporting packages [here](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/).
