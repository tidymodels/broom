  description: Posterior probability of predicted class  If the `data` argument is
    given, those columns are included in the output (only rows for which predictions
    could be made). Otherwise, the `y` element of the poLCA object, which contains
    the manifest variables used to fit the model, are used, along with any covariates,
    if present, in `x`.  Note that while the probability of all the classes (not just
    the predicted modal class) can be found in the `posterior` element, these are
    not included in the augmented output.
