  - Standard error of the statistic.  If weights were provided to the `boot` function,
    an `estimate` column is included showing the weighted bootstrap estimate, and
    the standard error is of that estimate.  If there are no original statistics in
    the "boot" object, such as with a call to `tsboot` with `orig.t = FALSE`, the
    `original` and `statistic` columns are omitted, and only `estimate` and `std.error`
    columns shown.
