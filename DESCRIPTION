Description: Summarizes key information about statistical
    objects in tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create
    plots and consistently work with large numbers of models at once.
    Broom provides three verbs that each provide different types of
    information about a model. tidy() summarizes information about model
    components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports
    information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures
    like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual
    observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence
    measures.
