\title{Augment data according to a tidied model}
\usage{
augment(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{model or other R object to convert to data frame}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to methods}
}
\description{
Given an R statistical model or other non-tidy object, add columns to the
original dataset such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments.
}
\details{
Note that by convention the first argument is almost always \code{data},
which specifies the original data object. This is not part of the S3
signature, partly because it prevents \link{rowwise_df_tidiers} from
taking a column name as the first argument.

This generic originated in the ggplot2 package, where it was called
"fortify."
