First, loading necessary packages setting defaults: Let’s try simple dataset, built-Orange. start coercing Orange tibble. gives nicer print method especially useful later start working list-columns. contains 35 observations three variables: Tree, age, circumference. Tree factor five levels describing five trees. might expected, age circumference correlated:  Suppose want test correlations individually within tree. can dplyr’s group_by: (Note correlations much higher aggregated one, furthermore can now see similar across trees). Suppose instead simply estimating correlation, want perform hypothesis test cor.test: contains multiple values want output. vectors length 1, p-value estimate, longer, confidence interval. can get nicely organized tibble using tidy function: Often, want perform multiple tests fit multiple models, different part data. case, recommend nest-map-unnest workflow. example, suppose want perform correlation tests different tree. start nesting data based group interest: run correlation test nested tibble using purrr::map: results list-column S3 objects. want tidy objects, can also map. Finally, want unnest tidied data frames can see results flat tibble. together, looks like: workflow becomes even useful applied regressions. Untidy output regression looks like: tidy results, get multiple rows output model: Now can handle multiple regressions using exactly workflow : can just easily use multiple predictors regressions, shown mtcars dataset. nest data automatic manual cars (column), perform regression within nested tibble. want just tidy output, augment glance outputs well, still performing regression ? Since ’re using list-columns, can just fit model use multiple list-columns store tidied, glanced augmented outputs. combining estimates p-values across groups tidy data frame (instead list output model objects), new class analyses visualizations becomes straightforward. includes Sorting p-value estimate find significant terms across tests P-value histograms Volcano plots comparing p-values effect size estimates cases, can easily filter, facet, distinguish based term column. short, makes tools tidy data analysis available results data analysis models, just inputs.","code":"library(broom) library(tibble) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(purrr)  theme_set(theme_minimal()) data(Orange)  Orange <- as_tibble(Orange) Orange ## # A tibble: 35 × 3 ##    Tree    age circumference ##    <ord> <dbl>         <dbl> ##  1 1       118            30 ##  2 1       484            58 ##  3 1       664            87 ##  4 1      1004           115 ##  5 1      1231           120 ##  6 1      1372           142 ##  7 1      1582           145 ##  8 2       118            33 ##  9 2       484            69 ## 10 2       664           111 ## # ℹ 25 more rows cor(Orange$age, Orange$circumference) ## [1] 0.9135189 ggplot(Orange, aes(age, circumference, color = Tree)) +   geom_line() Orange |>   group_by(Tree) |>   summarize(correlation = cor(age, circumference)) ## # A tibble: 5 × 2 ##   Tree  correlation ##   <ord>       <dbl> ## 1 3           0.988 ## 2 1           0.985 ## 3 5           0.988 ## 4 2           0.987 ## 5 4           0.984 ct <- cor.test(Orange$age, Orange$circumference) ct ##  ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation ##  ## data:  Orange$age and Orange$circumference ## t = 12.9, df = 33, p-value = 1.931e-14 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ##  0.8342364 0.9557955 ## sample estimates: ##       cor  ## 0.9135189 tidy(ct) ## # A tibble: 1 × 8 ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method       ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>        ## 1    0.914      12.9 1.93e-14        33    0.834     0.956 Pearson's p… ## # ℹ 1 more variable: alternative <chr> nested <- Orange |>   nest(data = -Tree) nested |>   mutate(test = map(data, ~ cor.test(.x$age, .x$circumference))) ## # A tibble: 5 × 3 ##   Tree  data             test    ##   <ord> <list>           <list>  ## 1 1     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> ## 2 2     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> ## 3 3     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> ## 4 4     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> ## 5 5     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> nested |>   mutate(     test = map(data, ~ cor.test(.x$age, .x$circumference)), # S3 list-col     tidied = map(test, tidy)   ) ## # A tibble: 5 × 4 ##   Tree  data             test    tidied           ##   <ord> <list>           <list>  <list>           ## 1 1     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> <tibble [1 × 8]> ## 2 2     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> <tibble [1 × 8]> ## 3 3     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> <tibble [1 × 8]> ## 4 4     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> <tibble [1 × 8]> ## 5 5     <tibble [7 × 2]> <htest> <tibble [1 × 8]> Orange |>   nest(data = -Tree) |>   mutate(     test = map(data, ~ cor.test(.x$age, .x$circumference)), # S3 list-col     tidied = map(test, tidy)   ) |>   unnest(tidied) ## # A tibble: 5 × 11 ##   Tree  data     test    estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low ##   <ord> <list>   <list>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl> ## 1 1     <tibble> <htest>    0.985      13.0  4.85e-5         5    0.901 ## 2 2     <tibble> <htest>    0.987      13.9  3.43e-5         5    0.914 ## 3 3     <tibble> <htest>    0.988      14.4  2.90e-5         5    0.919 ## 4 4     <tibble> <htest>    0.984      12.5  5.73e-5         5    0.895 ## 5 5     <tibble> <htest>    0.988      14.1  3.18e-5         5    0.916 ## # ℹ 3 more variables: conf.high <dbl>, method <chr>, alternative <chr> lm_fit <- lm(age ~ circumference, data = Orange) summary(lm_fit) ##  ## Call: ## lm(formula = age ~ circumference, data = Orange) ##  ## Residuals: ##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  ## -317.88 -140.90  -17.20   96.54  471.16  ##  ## Coefficients: ##               Estimate Std.
