#' @description Tidy summarizes information about the components of a model.
#'   A model component might be a single term in a regression, a single
#'   hypothesis, a cluster, or a class. Exactly what tidy considers to be a
#'   model component varies cross models but is usually self-evident.
#'   If a model has several distinct types of components, you will need to
#'   specify which components to return.
