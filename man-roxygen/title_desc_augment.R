#' @title Augment data with information from a(n) <%= class %> object
#' 
#' @description Augment accepts a model object and a dataset and adds
#'   information about each observation in the dataset. Most commonly, this
#'   includes predicted values in the `.fitted` column, residuals in the 
#'   `.resid` column, and standard errors for the fitted values in a `.se.fit`
#'   column. New columns always begin with a `.` prefix to avoid overwriting
#'   columns in the original dataset.
#'   
#'   Users may pass data to augment via either the `data` argument or the
#'   `newdata` argument. If the user passes data to the `data` argument,
#'   it **must** be exactly the data that was used to fit the model
#'   object. Pass datasets to `newdata` to augment data that was not used
#'   during model fitting. This still requires that at least all predictor 
#'   variable columns used to fit the model are present. If the original outcome
#'   variable used to fit the model is not included in `newdata`, then no
#'   `.resid` column will be included in the output.
#'   
#'   Augment will often behave differently depending on whether `data` or 
#'   `newdata` is given. This is because there is often information
#'   associated with training observations (such as influences or related)
#'   measures that is not meaningfully defined for new observations.
#'   
#'   For convenience, many augment methods provide default `data` arguments,
#'   so that `augment(fit)` will return the augmented training data. In these
#'   cases, augment tries to reconstruct the original data based on the model
#'   object with varying degrees of success.
#'   
#'   The augmented dataset is always returned as a [tibble::tibble] with the
#'   **same number of rows** as the passed dataset. This means that the
#'   passed data must be coercible to a tibble. At this time, tibbles do not
#'   support matrix-columns. This means you should not specify a matrix
#'   of covariates in a model formula during the original model fitting
#'   process, and that [splines::ns()], [stats::poly()] and
#'   [survival::Surv()] objects are not supported in input data. If you
#'   encounter errors, try explicitly passing a tibble, or fitting the original
#'   model on data in a tibble.
#'   
#'   We are in the process of defining behaviors for models fit with various 
#'   `na.action` arguments, but make no guarantees about behavior when data is
#'   missing at this time.
