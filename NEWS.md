# broom 0.5.1.9000
To be released as 0.7.0

## Changes to `augment()`

have overhauled `augment()` for general consistency improvements (hopefully, pending getting `safepredict()` going urgh)

- If you pass a dataset to `augment()` via the `data` or `newdata` arguments, you are now guaranteed that the augmented dataset will have exactly the same number of rows as the original dataset. This differs from previous behavior primarily when there are missing values. Previously `augment()` would drop rows containing `NA`. This should no longer be the case.

- `augment()` no longer accepts an `na.action` argument
- We no longer cram everything through `augment.lm()` and it has subsequently losts a lot of arguments that were needed when it was a frankenstein do everything function
- `augment()` tries to give an informative error when `data` isn't the original training data

## Degrees of freedom in `glance.lm()` have changed! (#212, #273)

Previously the `df` column in `glance` reported the rank of the design matrix. Now it reports degrees of freedom of the numerator for the overall F-statistic. This is always equals equal to the rank of the model matrix minus one, so the new `df` will always be the old `df` minus one.

TODO: sort out what happens to `glance.aov()`

## Structural changes

- We now use `rlang::arg_match()` when possible instead of `arg.match()` to give more informative errors on argument mismatches.
- Moved core tests to the `modeltests` package
- Added new vignette detailing use of `modelgenerics` and `modeltests` packages
- Added `data` argument to `augment()` generic (did this happen?)

## Additional control over confidence intervals

- All `conf.int` arguments now default to `FALSE`. This primarily effects `tidy.survreg()`, which previously always returned confidence intervals.
- All `conf.level` arguments now default to `0.95`.
- `tidy.lsmobj()` gained a `conf.int` argument

## New tidiers, features and bugfixes

- Added `tidy.regsubsets()` for best subsets linear regression from the `leaps` package
- Added method `tidy.lm.beta()` to tidy `lm.beta` class models (#545 by @mattle24)
- `tidy.kmeans()` now uses the names of the input variables in the output by default. Set `col.names = NULL` to recover the old behavior.
- `tidy_optim()` now returns the standard error provides the standard error if the Hessian is present. (#529 by @billdenney) (TODO: think about this)
- `glance.biglm()` now returns a `df.residual` column
- `tidy.htest()` column names are now run through `make.names()` to ensure syntactic correctness (#549 by @karissawhiting) (TODO: use tidyverse name repair?)


### Name changes for consistency

- `augment.htest()`:
  - `.residuals` -> `.resid`
  - `.stdres` -> `.std.resid`
  - These changes only effect chi-squared tests
- `tidy.ridgelm()` will now always return a `GCV` column and never returns an `xm` column (#532)

### Bug fixes

- Bug fix for `tidy.mlm()` when passed `quick = TRUE` (#539 by @MatthieuStigler)
- Bug fix for `tidy.polr()` when passed `conf.int = TRUE` (#498)
- Bug fix in `glance.lavaan()` (#577)

## Deprecations

### Hard deprecations

**Planned**

- Data frame, rowwise data frame, vector and matrix tidiers have been removed
- `bootstrap()` has been removed

**Unplanned**

The following tidiers have been removed from `broom` but were not soft deprecated in the previous release:

- `glance.summary.lm()`
- `augment.glmRob()`

We regret that we were unable to provide any warning for these changes.

The `robust` package does not provide the functionality necessary to implement an augment method. We are looking into supporting the `robustbase` package in the future.

### Mixed model deprecations

The following have all been deprecated in favor of `broom.mixed`:

- `tidy.brmsfit()`
- `tidy.merMod()`, `glance.merMod()`, `augment.merMod()`
- `tidyMCMC()`, `tidy.rjags()`, `tidy.stanfit()`
- `tidy.lme()`, `glance.lme()`, `augment.lme()`
- `tidy.stanreg()`, `glance.stanreg()`

### Soft deprecations

- `tidy.table()` and `tidy.ftable()` have been deprecated in favor of `tibble::as_tibble()`
- `tidy.summaryDefault()` has been deprecated in favor of `skimr::skim()`

# broom 0.5.1

- `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()` are now re-exported from the [generics](https://github.com/r-lib/generics) package.

# broom 0.5.0

Tidiers now return `tibble::tibble()`s. This release also includes several new tidiers, new vignettes and a large number of bugfixes. We've also begun to more rigorously define tidier specifications: we've laid part of the groundwork for stricter and more consistent tidying, but the new tidier specifications are not yet complete. These will appear in the next release.

Additionally, users should note that we are in the process of migrating tidying methods for mixed models and Bayesian models to `broom.mixed`. `broom.mixed` is not on CRAN yet, but all mixed model and Bayesian tidiers will be deprecated once `broom.mixed` is on CRAN. No further development of mixed model tidiers will take place in `broom`.

## Breaking changes

Almost all tidiers should now return `tibble`s rather than `data.frame`s. Deprecated tidying methods, Bayesian and mixed model tidiers still return `data.frame`s.

**Users** are mostly to experience issues when using `augment` in situations where tibbles are stricter than data frames. For example, specifying model covariates as a matrix object will now error:

```r
library(broom)
library(quantreg)

fit <- rq(stack.loss ~ stack.x, tau = .5)
broom::augment(fit)
#> Error: Column `stack.x` must be a 1d atomic vector or a list
```

This is because the default `data` argument `data = model.frame(fit)` cannot be coerced to `tibble`.

Another consequence of this is that `augment.survreg` and `augment.coxph` from the `survival` package now require that the user explicitly passes data to either the `data` or `newdata` arguments.

These restrictions will be relaxed in an upcoming release of `broom` pending support for matrix-columns in tibbles.

**Developers** are likely to experience issues:

- subsetting tibbles with `[`, which returns a tibble rather than a vector.
- setting rownames on tibbles, which is deprecated.
- using matrix and vector tidiers, now deprecated.
- handling the additional tibble classes `tbl_df` and `tbl` beyond the `data.frame` class
- linking to defunct documentation files -- broom recently moved all tidiers to a `roxygen2` template based documentation system.

## New vignettes

This version of `broom` includes several new vignettes:

- `vignette("available-methods", package = "broom")` contains a table detailing which tidying methods are available
- `vignette("adding-tidiers", package = "broom")` is an *in-progress* guide for contributors on how to add new tidiers to broom
- `vignette("glossary", package = "broom")` contains tables describing acceptable argument names and column names for the *in-progress* new specification.

Several old vignettes have also been updated:

- `vignette("bootstrapping", package = "broom")` now relies on the `rsample` package and a `tidyr::nest`-`purrr::map`-`tidyr::unnest` workflow. This is now the recommended workflow for working with multiple models, as opposed to the old `dplyr::rowwise`-`dplyr::do` based workflow.

## Deprecations

- Matrix and vector tidiers have been deprecated in  favor of `tibble::as_tibble` and `tibble::enframe`
- Dataframe tidiers and rowwise dataframe tidiers have been deprecated
- `bootstrap()` has been deprecated in favor of the [`rsample`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/)
- `inflate` has been removed from `broom`

## Other changes

- The `alpha` argument has been removed from `quantreg` tidy methods
- The `separate.levels` argument has been removed from `tidy.TukeyHSD`. To obtain the effect of `separate.levels = TRUE`, users may `tidyr::separate` after tidying. This is consistent with the `multcomp` tidier behavior.
- The `fe.error` argument was removed from `tidy.felm`. When fixed effects are tidier, their standard errors are now always included.
- The `diag` argument in `tidy.dist` has been renamed `diagonal`

* Fixed various issues in lme4 output
* Fixed issues in tests caused by dev version of ggplot2

* Added `tidy.coeftest` for coeftest objects from the lmtest package.
* Set up `tidy.lm` to work with "mlm" (multiple linear model) objects (those with multiple response columns).

# broom 0.3.6

* Fixed bug in `tidy.pairwise.htest`, which now can handle cases where the grouping variable is numeric.
* Added `tidy.aovlist` method. This added `stringr` package to IMPORTS to trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the `term` and `stratum` columns. This also required adjusting `tidy.aov` so that it could handle strata that are missing p-values.
* Set up `glance.lm` to work with `aov` objects along with `lm` objects.
* Added `tidy` and `glance` for matrix objects, with `tidy.matrix` converting a matrix to a data frame with rownames included, and `glance.matrix` returning the same result as `glance.data.frame`.
* Changed DESCRIPTION Authors@R to new format

# broom 0.3.5

* Fixed small bug in `felm` where the `.fitted` and `.resid` columns were matrices rather than vectors.
* Added tidiers for `rlm` (robust linear model) and `gam` (generalized additive model) objects, including adjustments to "lm" tidiers in order to handle them. See `?rlm_tidiers` and `?gam_tidiers` for more.
* Removed rownames from `tidy.cv.glmnet` output

# broom 0.3.4

* The behavior of `augment`, particularly with regard to missing data and the `na.exclude` argument, has through the use of the `augment_columns` function been made consistent across the following models:
    * `lm`
    * `glm`
    * `nls`
    * `merMod` (`lme4`)
    * `survreg` (`survival`)
    * `coxph` (`survival`)

    Unit tests in `tests/testthat/test-augment.R` were added to ensure consistency across these models.
* `tidy`, `augment` and `glance` methods were added for `rowwise_df` objects, and are set up to apply across their rows. This allows for simple patterns such as:

        regressions <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% do(mod = lm(mpg ~ wt, .))
        regressions %>% tidy(mod)
        regressions %>% augment(mod)

    See `?rowwise_df_tidiers` for more.
* Added `tidy` and `glance` methods for `Arima` objects, and `tidy` for `pairwise.htest` objects.
* Fixes for CRAN: change package description to title case, removed NOTES, mostly by adding `globals.R` to declare global variables.
* This is the original version published on CRAN.


# broom 0.3

* Tidiers have been added for S3 objects from the following packages:
    * `lme4`
    * `glmnet`
    * `survival`
    * `zoo`
    * `felm`
    * `MASS` (`ridgelm` objects)
* `tidy` and `glance` methods for data.frames have also been added, and `augment.data.frame` produces an error (rather than returning the same data.frame).
* `stderror` has been changed to `std.error` (affects many functions) to be consistent with broom's naming conventions for columns.
* A function `bootstrap` has been added based on [this example](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/issues/269), to perform the common use case of bootstrapping models.

# broom 0.2

* Added "augment" S3 generic and various implementations. "augment" does something different from tidy: it adds columns to the original dataset, including predictions, residuals, or cluster assignments. This was originally described as "fortify" in ggplot2.
* Added "glance" S3 generic and various implementations. "glance" produces a *one-row* data frame summary, which is necessary for tidy outputs with values like R^2 or F-statistics.
* Re-wrote intro broom vignette/README to introduce all three methods.
* Wrote a new kmeans vignette.
* Added tidying methods for multcomp, sp, and map objects (from fortify-multcomp, fortify-sp, and fortify-map from ggplot2).
* Because this integrates substantial amounts of ggplot2 code (with permission), added Hadley Wickham as an author in DESCRIPTION.
